Hi! This is the repository I'm using while studying Scala at Coursera, attending [this specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala).

In the folders you can find my excercise, some experiments and the assignments. As of today, I had to slow down the 3rd course because I need to study a bit of calculus to better understand the lessons.

Current status:

 Course        | Status           | Grade  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Functional Programming Principles in Scala | done | 96% |
| Functional Program Design in Scala | done | 100% |
| Parallel Programming | started |     |
| Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark | not started |     |
| Functional Programming in Scala Capstone | not started |     |
